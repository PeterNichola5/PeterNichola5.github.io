                        Hi! My name is Peter Nicholas and I graduated from CHCA highschool in the spring of 2021.
                        I began learning how to code in my softmore year of highschool after joining the FIRST robotics team.
                        There I learned the basics of java while on the controls team to help manipulate the robot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I grew to enjoy programming, I begin to seek out aditional learning material.
                        Junior year I decided to take AP Computer Science, which improved my understanding of algorithms and data manipulation.
                        By senior year, I began teaching myself C#, and begin messing around with my friend on Unreal Engine 4 in our school's computer lab.  
                        While our gaming project never got very far, playing around with Unreal taught me alot about problem solving, and inspired me to keep learning.

                    <p>
                        During my first semester of studying Astrophysics at the University of Cincinnati, I got into an acedemic slump and decided to take the
                        spring semester off to recooperate.  During this time, I spent the majority of my days either working a part time job or learning more about programming.
                        With the help of some youtube tutorials, i began making a 2D Java game from scratch.  I also enrolled in multiple classes through Codecademy, learning more about Java and C#.
